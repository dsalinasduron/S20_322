<a id="top">Scrum Process</a>

<p><b>Scrum</b> is a popular form of Agile. It follows the values listed in the
<a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/">Agile
Manifesto</a> as well as the <a
href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/">12
Principles of Agile</a>. Scrum is a methodology for project management. Other
forms of Agile, such as XP (extreme programming) and Kanban focus on different
aspects of software development. For example, although it also follows the
values in the manifesto and the 12 principles, XP focuses more on improving the
process of writing code than Scrum, which focuses on improving team
communication and interaction.</p> 

<p>In Scrum terms, developing software means implementing features specified in
the <b>backlog</b>. See <a
href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/backlog/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'backlog))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)">here</a>
for a definition of backlog. The team decides which features to work on, often
a <b>product owner</b> is involved. See <a
href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/product-owner/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'product*20owner~'product*20ownership))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)">here</a>
for a description of the role of the product owner.</p> 

<p>
Scrum development is done in cycles. One iteration of the cycle is a
<b>sprint</b>. A sprint has four <b>events</b>:
<ol>

	<li>The <b>sprint planning</b> session, where the team decides what
	part of the backlog to develop for the sprint.</li> 

	<li>The development itself. At the beginning of each workday, a
	<b>daily scrum</b> is held to keep team members appraised of emerging
	problems. See <a
	href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/daily-meeting/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'daily*20meeting))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)">here</a>
	for more information on the daily scrum.</li> 

	<li> After the development time is up, the team holds a <b>sprint
	review</b>, where they demo the software that was built during the
	sprint to the users.</li> 

	<li>The team then holds a <b>retrospective</b>. The team critically
	analyzes their performance to decide what to keep doing, what to stop
	doing, and some new things to try. See <a
	href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/heartbeatretro/#q=~(infinite~true~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video~'aa_podcast)~tags~(~'retrospective))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)">here</a>
	for more information on retrospectives.  </li> 

</ol> 
</p> 

<p>To ensure that the team uses the scrum methodology effectively, a <b>scrum
master</b> is appointed. See <a
href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum-master/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'scrum*20master))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)">here</a>
