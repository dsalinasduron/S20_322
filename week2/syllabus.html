<a class="section">Meeting Place and Time</a> 
<p>Our class will meet in Dick 117 during the following times
<table>
<tr><td>Tuesdays</td><td>2-4 p.m.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Thursdays</td><td>2-4 p.m.</td></tr>
</table> 
</p>

<a class="section">Catalog description</a> 

<p>An overview of constructing software using an Agile approach to software
development and design. Topics include software planning and design,
scheduling, testing and reliability, and software main- tenance. A
semester-long project developed in a group setting. Prerequisite: CMPT 202,
307.</p> 

<a class="section">Materials</a> 

<p>No textbook will be used in this course. Canvas will be used for general
class information and grading; most student work will be in GitHub.</p> 

<a class="section">Learning Goals</a> 

<a class="subsection">Institutional</a>

<p>This course addresses the following of Westminster's institutional learning
goals:

</ol>

<li><b>Critical thinking.</b> Programming is always a critical process.</li>

<li><b>Creativity.</b>Students will be creating original work in pursuit of
self-designed goals to solve a real problem.</li>

<li><b>Collaboration.</b>Most of the work of the class will be conducted in a
structured team setting with responsibility to and collaboration with the
team.</li>

<li><b>Communication.</b>Communication is key to keeping teams working on the
same page. This class also features aspects of communication endemic to
software development in the real world, e.g. ditributed version control.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<a class="subsection">Program</a>

<p>The program-wide learning goals of this course include:
<ol>

<li>To understand the concepts and techniques of software design. This course
focuses on soft- ware engineering concepts and introduces the Agile technique
of designing, developing, and delivering software.</li>

<li>To develop effective problem solving skills. During the course of your
project you will encounter several programming challenges which you will have
to apply problem solving skills to overcome.</li>

<li>To acquire significant experience working both individually and in a group
setting. This course involves working in a team setting while developing a
significant project.</li>

</ol>


<a class="section">Grading</a> 

<p>The grade breakdown follows below.</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Group project</td><td>60%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Quizzes</td><td>30%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Individual Work (outside project)</td><td>5%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Group work (outside project)</td><td>5%</td></tr>
</table> 

<p>Final grades will be determined with the usual 90/80/70/60 cutoffs. The
bottom 3% of a decile gets a minus and the top 3% gets a plus. (So 87% is a B+,
62% is a D-, and 73% is a C, but note that Wesminster does not have an A+
grade.) Any final score under 60% will be an F.</p>

<a class="section">Group Project</a> 

<p>Most of the course will be centered around a software engineering project
done in assigned groups of three to four students. As nearly as practical this
project will mimic the actual process of software design and development at a
company that uses Agile. The project will be completed through three successive
iterations producing releases, ranging from an initial prototype to a final
product release. Releases will follow a three-week production schedule.</p> 

<p>Release dates for this semester are as follows. These dates are firm.

<ol>

<li>Release 1 (R1): Thursday, February 25</li>
<li>Release 2 (R2): Thursday, March 31</li>
<li>Release 3 (R3): Monday, April 28</li>

</ol> 

Each release will be followed by a demonstration of the features developed to
date.</p>

<a class="section">Deadlines</a> 

<p>An important component of software engineering is designing schedules and
meeting deadlines. We will organize most assignments for this class through a
set of deliverables along with a due date for each deliverable. It is crucial
that you meet the required due date for each deliverable. If a deadline is
missed, the assignment for the missed deadline will be deducted by 25% for the
team for each day (weekends count as one day) the assignment is late.
Fortunately, the Agile approach we will be following emphasizes meeting
deadlines and encourages lessening requirements rather than extending the due
date.</p> 

<a class="section">Teamwork</a> 

<p>Most of the work you will complete this semester will be done as a team.
Teams will be assigned the first day of class and you will be expected to work
closely with your team throughout the semester. Teams will always sit together
in class and perform most exercises together. The most important component
produced by your team is your project, although there will be several smaller
assignments in addition to the project that are to be completed by the
team.</p> 

<p>Around 15 minutes of class time per week will be set aside for team meetings
("stand-ups"). In addition, a significant amount of class time will be used to
work on your project as a team. This means your team should come to each class
prepared to work. This also means that each individual team member is expected
to attend all classes. Missing a class is like missing a day of work and your
absence will mean lost productivity for your team. If you are unable to make a
class, it is important that you communicate your absence to your teammates as
soon as possible.</p> 

<a class="section">Problem Teammates</a> 

<p>Hopefully your team will be a collegial, fun, and productive group but
problems can occur. It is crucial that you identify any problems early on and
first try to resolve issues as a team. However, if one team member is not
fulfilling their responsibilities and the issue cannot be resolved as a team,
it is the responsibility of the team, or team coordinator, to notify me of
the problem. Hopefully this can address the problems and the team can resume
functioning productively. However, if problems persist after contacting me, the
team can decide to fire the problem member. Once fired, the former member can
apply for a job with another team. If they do find a job, that individual's
grade on the final project will be pro-rated according to the week of the
semester that they joined the new team. If they do not, their final project
grade will be the total amount of points the team has earned up to the time of
firing. In other words, students who get fired will find it very difficult to
pass the class!</p> 

<a class="section">Course Policies</a> 

<p><b>Pronouns, correct names, and inclusion.</b>It is your right to be
identified by your correct name and pronouns (those being entirely up to you).
I support people of all gender identities and expressions and welcome everyone
to identify themselves in whatever fashion they choose. In this spirit, I
expect all students to also use the correct pronouns and names of classmates.
Please inform me if my documentation reflects a name different than what you
use and if you have any questions or concerns please contact me after class, by
e-mail, or during my office hours.</p>

<p><b>Attendance.</b>I expect that you attend every class and do so with
punctuality. I will keep a record of your attendance throughout the semester
for administrative purposes, but attendance is not factored into your grade
(except insofar as missing class affects your and your team’s ability to
succeed).</p>

<p><b>Absences.</b>In the event you do miss a class, it is your responsibility
to let your team know with as much warning as possible and to communicate with
myself and your teammates to determine what you may have missed; in general I
will not allow make-up work to be turned in for credit. If, however, you have
either informed me in advance of the absence or produced documentation of the
reason, I may relax this policy at my discretion.</p>

<p><b>Communication.</b>Please stay in touch with me by e-mail or through
Canvas. (With e-mail you are likely to get a much faster response!) My office
phone is also an acceptable way to contact me, but in most cases e-mail is
likely to work better. I do my best to reply promptly to mail during working
hours (9-5 Monday-Friday); outside of these hours I will reply at my
convenience.</p>

<p>Please do your best to keep in contact with your team and let them know if
there are factors in your life that will reduce your availability. Git commits
and pull requests are a lousy way to stay in touch! You may wish to create a
discussion group of some sort for your team (on Discord, Canvas, or social
media) to better keep in touch. At a minimum you will see each other every
class day but that's only twice a week.</p>

<p><b>This syllabus is subject to change. Should changes be required, I will
promptly announce them and make an updated version of this document available
to students.</b></p> 

<a class="section">Your Resources and Protections</a>

<a class="subsection">Your Rights Under Federal Laws</a><br>

<b>Section 504 of Rehabilitation Act of 1973/ADA</b><p>Westminster College
seeks to provide equal access in higher education to academically qualified
students with physical, learning, and psychiatric disabilities. If you need
disability-related accommodations in this class, have emergency medical
information you wish to share with me, or need special arrangements in case the
building must be evacuated, please inform me immediately. Please see me
privately after class or in my office. Disability Services authorizes
disability-related academic accommodations in cooperation with the students
themselves and their instructors. Students who need academic accommodations or
have questions about their eligibility should contact Karen Hicks, Disability
Services Coordinator, in the basement of Giovale Library (801-832-2272) or
email disabilityservices at westminstercollege dot edu</p>
 
<p><b>Title IX</b> of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex
discrimination against any participant in an educational program or activity
that receives federal funds. Westminster is committed to providing a safe and
non-discriminatory learning, living, and working environment to all members of
the Westminster community and does not discriminate on the basis of sex. This
includes on the basis of gender, gender identity, gender expression,
nonconformity with gender stereotypes, or sexual orientation. The College's
Title IX policy strictly prohibits sexual assault, sexual harassment,
gender-based harassment, gender-based discrimination, sexual exploitation,
interpersonal violence (dating violence, domestic violence, stalking), and
retaliation for making a good faith report of prohibited conduct or
participating in any proceeding under the policy. The policy and accompanying
procedures are available <a
href="https://www.westminstercollege.edu/about/resources/title-ix">here</a>,
they and discuss prohibited conduct, resources, reporting, supportive measures,
rights, investigations, and sanctions for violations of the policy.</p>


<p>If you want to make a report of prohibited conduct, you may contact
Westminster's Title IX Coordinator, Kat Thomas, or report an incident online.
Kat can be reached at kthomas at westminstercollege dot edu, 801-832-2262, or
in Malouf 107. You can also contact Deputy Coordinator Traci Siriprathane at
tsiriprathane at westminstercollege dot edu, or 801-832-2862, or in HWAC 210.
Please note that to the extent permitted by law, the College aims to protect
the privacy of all parties involved in the investigation and resolution of
reported violations of the policy. However, the College has a duty to look into
and take actions in response to reports and cannot guarantee confidentiality or
that an investigation will not be pursued.  The Counseling Center is a
confidential resource, and by law the counselors who work there cannot reveal
confidential information to any third party without express permission unless
there is an imminent threat of harm to self or others. <b>As an instructor I am
a responsible employee and am required to report any information I obtain
regarding conduct that may violate the policy to the Title IX Coordinator so
that students can receive supportive measures and referrals to resources, they
are aware of their options, and the safety of the campus community can be
ensured.</b> If you begin to disclose an incident of prohibited conduct, I may
interrupt you because I want to make sure that you have had the opportunity to
discuss the incident with confidential resources on and off campus first.  If
you need supportive measures inside or outside the classroom because of an
incident of prohibited conduct, please reach out to the Title IX Coordinator
for assistance. </p>

<p><b>Title VI</b> of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination
based on race, color, or national origin in any program or activity receiving
federal financial assistance. In addition to these, Westminster's Equal
Opportunity policy prohibits discrimination or harassment based on ethnicity,
age, religion, military status, or genetic information in any of its programs
or activities. If you encounter this type of discrimination or harassment, or
feel that you have been retaliated against for reporting prohibited conduct or
participating in any related proceeding, you can contact the Equal Opportunity
Administrator, Westminster's Title IX Coordinator, Kat Thomas, or report an
incident online. Kat can be reached at kthomas at westminstercollege dot edu,
801-832-2262, or in Malouf 107. The equal opportunity policy and procedures can
be accessed from the Student Life webpage. <b>As an instructor, just as with
Title IX, I am a responsible employee and am required to report any information
I obtain regarding discrimination or harassment to the Equal Opportunity
Officer for further review.</b></p>
