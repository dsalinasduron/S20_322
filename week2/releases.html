<p>The development cycle for this class will consist of three <b>sprints</b>.
Sprints are periods where the primary activity is software development and
typically consist of several iterations. Due to limited time, each sprint for
this class will consist of a single iteration. For each sprint, you will have
at least six dedicated class periods for development. There will be a class
period for replanning between sprints. The following release dates reflect
that.</p> 
<table>

<tr><td>31 March (Tuesday)</td><td>Release 2 Due</td></tr>
